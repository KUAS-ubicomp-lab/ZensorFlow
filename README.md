# ZensorsFlow: Integrating Real-Time Data from Wearable Sensors

## About the Project

ZensorsFlow is a cross-platform application developed to integrate and manage real-time data from multiple wearable sensors, catering to the evolving needs of mobile health (mHealth) and real-time health monitoring. This application was developed using the Flutter framework for both iOS and Android, ensuring a consistent user experience across varied platforms. It incorporates real-time data streaming and management via InfluxDB cloud service, providing efficient handling of time-series data from wearable devices.
